									<p>What is e-waste? And how do we dispose of it?

								E-waste is electronic products that are unwanted, not working, and nearing or at the end of their “useful life.” Computers, televisions, VCRs, stereos, copiers, and fax machines are everyday electronic products.

							The ongoing challenge of how best to dispose of used and unwanted electronics isn’t a new one and dates back at least to the 1970s. But a lot has changed since then, particularly the number of electronics being discarded today.

						We also have something else today: a term for this issue. After several terms got suggested, including “Digital rubbish,” a consensus formed around the simple word “e-waste.”</p>
					<p>In addition to our full espresso and brew bar menu, we serve fresh made-to-order breakfast and lunch sandwiches, as well as a selection of sides and salads and other good stuff.</p>
